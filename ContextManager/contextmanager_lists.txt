ContextManager lists
------------------------------

Purpose variable chat manager, nice API, other contexts too.

----------------------------
- PermissionsEx prefixes with respecting groups weights.
- Set recipients for chat, ignore players, chat channels, tell shortcut.
- mcMMO party chat is recognized and logged.
- Annoucements with Commands or shortcut ! (channel wide) or !! (global).
    Possible from of mcMMO party chat
- Tell-style comamnd + shortcut (@ ...).

UNDER REVIEW / ISSUES
----------------------------

Currently ContextManager is being restructured slightly.

- mcMMO party chat is only logged, the configuration has no effect, 
    except for use-event. Announcements should work.
- Soon/later: Vault support for prefixes.
- Soon/later: Support for not having any plugin for prefixes.
- mcMMO admin chat is not yet treated in any way.

Normal chat:
* @ <player> ....<message>... | @<player> ...<message>...
    Like tell.

* cx recipients ...
    Aliases: cxr
    Add recipients of chat, only these people can hear you,
    you can only hear them, they might hear others.
    If you have permission for /cx greedy , then you can use that

* cx find ...
    Aliases: cx f ...
    Find stuff, this is the general shortcut which will delegate  
     to all available services.
    it will work for regions and for items (ChestShop).
    However there is permission setup necessary, or configuration to make these work!
 
Region service:
* cx region find <region name>
You can always use this to find regions youre owner or member of.
    regions.find.w.<world>.r.<region>
    Abbreviate for a world: regions.find.w.<world>.*
    Use lower case world and region names for permissions!
 
ChestShop service:
This only works if filters are set (filter.yml)!
The filters contain lists of regions for each world section.
Any region that is inside of such a filter region will
be added to the shop finder when shops are used on it.
So shops do need extra regions inside of the filter regins.  
* cx shop <region name or item name>
    Show items and prices of recently bought or sold stuff.
    Or show which shops sell  or buy it.
* cx shopp info <region name>
    Show items (...).
* cx shop find <item>
    Show regions that sell the items
* cx shop find <region name>
    Show distance to shop, should work for all shops that match the fiters.

Administrative context commands:
* cx history | cx history <number>
    Shortcut: cx h ...
    Show chat history (last 50 or number ... number + 50).
    contextmanager.admin.cmd.history
    contextmanager.history.display.channel
    contextmanager.history.display.default
    contextmanager.history.display.private
    contextmanager.history.display.party
* cx services
    Show available mix-in in services (ChestShop, region finding). 
    
Administrative commands:
* cmreload 
    Reload configuration (s).
    contextmanager.admin.cmd.reload
* mute <player> | mute <player> <minutes>
    contextmanager.admin.cmd.mute
    contextmanager.admin.cmd.mute.mild <- for 20 minutes mute
* unmute <player>
    contextmanager.admin.cmd.unmute
* muted
    List of muted players.
    contextmanager.admin.cmd.muted

    If false it will not add shops from unowned regions.

    If to use the WorldGuard region filter, i.e. that shops only get
    added if they are inside of a filter region (usually the town region).
* expiration-duration
    Expiration time in days, for when to invalidate shop entries.

    Used for sell/buy if you reversed the buttons in the 
    ChestShop configuration.
    Not sure this is still used, have to check it ....

filter.yml:

This file contains the filter setup (see above: use-filter).
In the section allow-regions you can enter a list of regions in
a section for each world, example:

allow-regions:
  mainworld:
